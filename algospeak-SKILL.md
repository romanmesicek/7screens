# Algospeak Content Skill

Apply linguistic patterns shaped by attention economics—writing that earns continued reading when readers can leave at any moment.

## Core Principles

### 1. The Curiosity Gap

Create cognitive tension between "knowing something exists" and "knowing what it is."

**Structure:**
- **Promise**: Signal valuable information exists
- **Withhold**: Delay the key insight
- **Accessibility**: Imply resolution is achievable by continuing

Close too early → reader leaves. Never close → reader feels cheated.

### 2. The Goldilocks Zone

| Too Vague | Goldilocks | Too Detailed |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| "Some insights about strategy" | "The strategy gap killing mid-size firms" | "The Q3 2024 competitive positioning analysis of 47 mid-size manufacturing firms in the DACH region" |

Enough detail to intrigue, not enough to satisfy without reading.

### 3. Floor Holding

Scatter **microhooks** throughout to recapture wandering attention:
- "But here's where it gets interesting..."
- "What we didn't expect..."
- "The real finding came later..."
- "This is where most analyses stop."

Critical in content over 500 words. Attention decays; microhooks reset it.

### 4. Authenticity Markers

- Specific numbers over round ones ("47" not "about 50")
- Named examples over generic references
- Acknowledged uncertainty where honest
- First-person perspective where appropriate
- Imperfect structures that sound human

## Hook Patterns (Universal)

| Pattern | Structure | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Counter-intuitive** | "[Belief] is wrong." | "The most detailed reports get ignored." |
| **Quantified mystery** | "[Number]. [Withheld why]." | "73% of transformations fail. Not for the reason you think." |
| **Stakes revelation** | "What's at risk if [X]..." | "What happens when your best assumption is wrong." |
| **Insider signal** | "What [experts] know that [others] don't." | "The metric experienced analysts actually watch." |
| **Method tease** | "The [single thing] that predicts [outcome]." | "One question that reveals project health." |
| **Tension opening** | Start mid-problem. | "The call came at 6am. Our entire model was wrong." |

## Anti-Patterns

### AI-Detection Triggers
These signal machine-generated content and reduce trust:
- Transition words: "Moreover," "Furthermore," "In conclusion," "Additionally"
- Generic intensifiers: "crucial," "vital," "game-changing," "revolutionary"
- Perfect parallelism throughout
- Absence of specific examples or numbers
- Hedging without substance: "It's important to note that..."

### Authenticity Violations
- **Clickbait without payoff**: Hook promises more than content delivers
- **False urgency**: "You need to know this NOW"
- **Vague authority**: "Studies show..." (which studies?)
- **Excessive hedging**: "It could potentially perhaps be argued..."

### Structural Failures
- **Buried hook**: Preamble before the interesting part
- **Premature resolution**: Giving away the answer too early
- **Missing microhooks**: Long stretches without attention reset
- **Weak endings**: Fading out instead of landing

## Application by Document Type

### Blog Posts / Articles

**Goal:** Shareability and completion

- Hook must work standalone (social preview)
- Promise a transformation ("after reading this, you'll...")
- Create tribal identification ("if you've ever felt X...")
- Payoff must exceed hook's promise

**Structure:**
```
[HOOK: Counter-intuitive or quantified mystery]
[CONTEXT: Why this matters now]
[STORY/EVIDENCE: Specific example grounding the insight]
[MICROHOOKS: At section transitions]
[INSIGHT: Core revelation—delivers on hook]
[TAKEAWAY: Practical application]
[ENDING: Opens new question or lands firmly]
```

### Executive Summaries / Abstracts

**Goal:** Earn the full read

- Lead with the most surprising or consequential finding
- Create curiosity about *how* you arrived at it
- Quantify stakes ("€2.3M at risk" not "significant exposure")

**Anti-pattern:** Summarizing everything—leaves no reason to continue

### Reports / Analysis

**Goal:** Sustain attention through length

- Hook in opening paragraph
- Microhooks at section transitions
- Each section has its own mini-hook
- Save a genuine surprise for later sections
- End with implications, not just summary

**Anti-pattern:** Burying insights in the middle; front-loading all value

### Proposals / Pitches

**Goal:** Create desire for resolution (working with you)

- Open with the client's unresolved tension, not your credentials
- Delay the solution reveal
- Show you understand something they haven't articulated

**Anti-pattern:** Leading with "About Us"; premature solution reveal

### Emails / Short Communications

**Goal:** Get the read and the response

- Subject line = hook (curiosity gap in <50 characters)
- First sentence must earn the second
- Bury the ask after establishing value/context
- End with easy next step, not open-ended request

**Anti-pattern:** Subject lines that summarize; leading with the ask

## LinkedIn-Specific Guidance

### Algorithm Essentials

LinkedIn prioritizes **dwell time** over quick engagement. The platform rewards "knowledge and advice" content.

Key factors:
- First 125 characters visible before "see more"—this is the hook window
- Optimal length: 1,800–2,100 characters (text-only) or 900–1,200 (with image)
- Under 1,000 characters loses ~25% potential engagement
- AI-generated content penalized 30–55%
- First 60–90 minutes determine ~70% of post reach

### LinkedIn Post Structure

```
[HOOK: Max 125 chars—curiosity gap, no resolution]

[CONTEXT: 1-2 sentences expanding the situation]

[STORY/EVIDENCE: Specific example, data, or experience]

[MICROHOOK: Attention recapture before payoff]

[INSIGHT: Core lesson—delivers on hook promise]

[TAKEAWAY: Practical application]

[SOFT CTA: Invitation to engage, not demand]
```

### LinkedIn Formatting
- Short paragraphs (1–3 sentences)
- Line breaks for rhythm
- 3–5 hashtags maximum, at end if used
- No engagement baiting ("Like if you agree")

## Transformation Process

### Step 1: Find the Buried Hook

Most drafts contain a good hook—usually buried in paragraph 3 or 4. Find the moment of genuine insight or surprise. Move it up.

### Step 2: Create the Gap

Split the insight:
- The existence of the insight → opening
- The content of the insight → later

### Step 3: Add Microhooks

For content over 500 words, insert attention resets at natural transition points.

### Step 4: Check the Payoff

Does the content actually deliver what the hook promised? Readers forgive difficulty but not disappointment.

### Step 5: Audit for AI Patterns

Read aloud. Does it sound like a person? Remove transitions that feel mechanical. Add specifics that feel observed.

## Audience Calibration

### Expert Audiences
- More in-group terminology acceptable
- Curiosity gaps can be subtler
- Credibility established through precision

### General / Mixed Audiences
- Balance jargon with accessibility
- Curiosity gaps need clearer structure
- Explain stakes in universal terms

### Executive Audiences
- Lead with implications, not process
- Quantify everything possible
- Curiosity gap = "what should I do about this?"

---

## Output Format

When transforming material, provide:

1. **Transformed content**—Ready to use
2. **Hook pattern used**—Brief note on choice
3. **Alternative hook**—Different pattern for A/B consideration

For LinkedIn posts specifically, ensure first 125 characters work standalone.

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing:

- [ ] Opening creates genuine curiosity gap
- [ ] First paragraph earns the second
- [ ] Specific details included (numbers, names, examples)
- [ ] Microhooks present in longer content
- [ ] Each section has mini-tension
- [ ] Payoff delivers on hook's promise
- [ ] Sounds human, not templated
- [ ] No AI-pattern red flags
- [ ] Ending lands (not just stops)
- [ ] Calibrated for audience type

## Example Transformation

**Input (rough notes):**
"been thinking about how most sustainability reports are just compliance documents nobody reads. companies spend months on them. saw a study that 80% never get read beyond exec summary. the good ones tell a story."

**Output (LinkedIn):**

80% of sustainability reports are never read beyond the executive summary.

Companies spend months producing them. Consultants bill thousands of hours.

And almost nobody reads them.

I've reviewed dozens of these reports. The pattern is clear: the ones that get ignored are written for auditors. The ones that create change are written for humans.

Here's the difference:

Auditor-focused reports prove compliance. They answer "did we meet the requirement?"

Human-focused reports create understanding. They answer "why should I care?"

The irony? Both can contain the same information. The difference is structure and intent.

Before your next report, ask: are we writing to prove something or to change something?

---

**Hook pattern:** Quantified mystery—80% statistic creates curiosity about why

**Alternative hook:** "I've read 47 sustainability reports this year. Only 3 were worth finishing."
